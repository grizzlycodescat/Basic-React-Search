The code can be copied straight into the console on a chrome browser. 

Question 1: 

This function takes in a number as an argument, and prints the result to the console. 

It can be found in question1.js

Question 3. 

Now this one I'm still struggling with... Will update readme when I either figure it out, or finally succumb to my need to google it.
